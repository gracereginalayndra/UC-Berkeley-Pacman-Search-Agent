# UC-Berkeley-Pacman-Search-Agent
This project incorporates the development of an AI Pac-Man agent that includes classic search (A*, adversarial), reinforcement learning (MDP, Q-learning), and supervised machine learning for gameplay. Demonstrates progression from foundational search algorithms to advanced learning-based AI planning inspired by UC Berkeley CS188 course assignment.
